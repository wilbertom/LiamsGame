I'm creating a kid's video game that needs some game assets.
The assets should not have backgrounds, floors or shadows.

We're aiming for cute characters for a toddler's cartoon including:
* Animal characters
* Food characters
* Plant characters
* Fantasy creature characters

The style should not be hyper realistic or 3D.
The assets should include character's entire's body.

Can you generate the images for:

* A baby calf
* A baby dog
* A baby horse
* A baby cat
* A star

Each character should be on its own PNG image, with a completely white background.
There should only be one instance of the character on the image.
There should be plenty of padding between the character so that body parts do not clip off.
